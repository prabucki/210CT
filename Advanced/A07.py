TASK OBJECTIVE:

Let's consider a labyrinth as a n Ã— m matrix, where the corridors are denoted by 1s situated
in consecutive positions on the same line or column. The rest of the elements are 0. Within
the labyrinth, a person is considered to be in position (i, j). Write a program that lists all exit
routes which do not pass the same place twice.
Input: n, m, the rows of the matrix, the coordinates of the exit and the coordinates of the
person (row, column). Output: a sequence of row/column pairs representing the person's
successive position.
